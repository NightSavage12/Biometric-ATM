# Biometric ATM System

## Project Overview
The Biometric ATM System is an advanced security-enabled ATM interface that leverages biometric authentication for secure user access. This project aims to enhance ATM security by replacing traditional PIN-based authentication with biometric verification, such as fingerprint recognition.

## Features
- **Biometric Authentication**: Uses fingerprint scanning for user verification.
- **Secure Transactions**: Provides enhanced security by preventing unauthorized access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with a web-based or GUI front-end for ease of use.
- **Database Integration**: Stores user biometric data securely.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporates AI models for biometric verification.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask/Django for backend processing)
- **OpenCV** (for biometric image processing)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (for user data storage)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for front-end development)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (for biometric recognition)

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NightSavage12/Biometric-ATM.git
   cd Biometric-ATM
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```sh
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- **Register your biometric data** upon first use.
- **Scan your fingerprint** to authenticate and access ATM services.
- **Perform transactions securely** with biometric verification.

## Deployment
To deploy the application on Heroku:
1. **Login to Heroku**
   ```sh
   heroku login
   ```
2. **Create a new Heroku app**
   ```sh
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```
3. **Deploy the app**
   ```sh
   git push heroku main
   heroku open
   ```
